**Concept**

This simple demo was created to recreate mechanics from games like Total War - moving groups of units consisting of multiple single entities, firing at each other and so on.
In current state of completion (a9fd173) it allows for spawning multiple groups of units and moving them around in order. It allows for shooting in different ways (salvo/free for all). Formations are filling gaps created by dead units.
Further commits are targeting melee engagement mechanisc.


**Art and assets**

Some graphics are used as placeholder, from Warmachine & Hordes tabletop game.
